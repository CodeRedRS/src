    Edgeville Yews (Still needs door handling)
Added a Basic chat response (BETA, use at own risk)
    Only replys once every 60sec to avoid spamming if someone says something repeatedly
    Will reply back with woodcutting level if someone asks "lvl" or "level"
    Will reply back "Thanks" or "You?" if someone says "nice", "cool", or "sweet"
Lag issues should be fixed now
Some banking locations don't work because of a client bug, nothing I can fix
    Falador is the only one I'm aware of currently
